        Do you always need to share an advert on whatsapp and you need to
        provide a clickable link for customers to easily chat you up directly
        but find it difficult or stressful to do always?
      </p>
      <p>
        Something like:
        <br /> "DM me with {""}
        <a href="https://wa.me/2349036058937"> wa.me/2349036058937</a> for more
        enquiry"
      </p>
      <p>
        Or do you even want a prewritten message embedded for your customers to
        chat you up from your advert? <br />
        <a href="https://api.whatsapp.com/send?phone=2349036058937&text=Hi%20Laplace%2C%20I%20saw%20your%20advert%20and%20I%20want%20to%20buy%20the%20data%20at%20%23350%2Fgb">
